From 4.0 (2.0) to 4.0 (2.0)
From version 9
Gecko 2.0 only sends x and y coordinates when clicked, not longer the name/value of the element
Gecko treats the value the same as optimizeLegibility.
IE 10
If the font size is 20 px or higher, Gecko browsers use optimizeLegibility; for smaller text, they use optimizeSpeed.
In versions previous to 1.5: -moz-outline-color
